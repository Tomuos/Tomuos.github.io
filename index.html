            <h2>The Man</h2>
            <p>
              
            Kevin Conroy is best known for his starring role as Bruce Wayne and his
            alter ego Batman, from the award winning show
            <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103359/">Batman: The Animated Series</a>
            </p>
        
            <img class="smallImg" src="images/conroy 228x300.png"/>
              <p>
              There are many iterations of Batman but few have played the role longer
              than Kevin, his dedication to the craft of both Bruce Wayne and Batman are
              far more impressive when you know realise some of the similarities Kevin
              went through in his life. For several generations, when you asked who was
              the the definitive Batman people would say Kevin Conroy.
              </p>
        
              <p>
              The reason his depiction of Batman works so well may be that he draws of
              real events from his own life. These events molded him and allows him to
              give truthful and emotional range that you wouldn't expect from what was
              supposed to be considered a childrens superhero cartoon. Batman is born
              from tradegy but is reforged into hope to give strength to those
              struggling. As you read on you will see the hardships Kevin faced
              throughout his life but still he persevered.

            up." <cite>-- Batman, Zero Year</cite>

            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>
              It wasn't an easy life It was a rocky upbringing in the Conroy house,
              born into a disfuctional family. Kevin and his older siblings had to
              deal with an alcoholic and abusive father. His siblings moved out as
              soon as they could leaving kevin and his mother to deal with his father.
              Things got so bad at one point his father attempted suicide while Kevin
              Conroy was in High School.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eventually his father was taken away and Kevin and his mother had short
              period of peace before his father returned, his mother moved out leaving
              him to deal with his father on his own. At the age of 16 he left home to
              stay with a friends family to finish his high school.
            </p>
            <p>
              Kevin believes theatre saved him, all thanks to an english teacher Joyce
              Wilkes. Which he believes saw something in him that nobody else had. He
              believes she saved his life by giving him an outlet to be more and
              because of this small push he ended up landing a lead character role in
              a school play. So he developed a great love for theatre and acting and
              managed to get a scholarship to Juilliard school to study drama and
              moved to new york at the age of 17

              Conroy did a lot of television work as well landing some guest roles on
              a few popular shows like Cheers and Matlock.</p> <p>Other set backs in his
              Career came from the film and tv idustries predjudice against hiring gay
              people. Especially with the AID's epidemic on going he struggled to find
              work, he also had to deal with the great loss of many friends.</p> 
              <p>Conroy 
had aquired the family home of his late father which is where his
              brother lived as it was familiar so Kevin worked primarily out of new
              york so he could always visit to make sure things were okay Conroy's
              sibling suffered from mental breaks and inbetween work he tried to make
              sure his brother was looked after.

              Kevin happened to be doing a pilot for a new show LA, out of the blue he
              was contacted for some voice overwork for a new show. He was asked to
              voice one character in particular. Batman. Andrea Romano had been
              searching for the voice of Batman for sometime and claims she had heard
              over 500 actors and not one of them had the right depth and feel. </p>

              <p>Conroy nailed the audition as he was able to put himself in the place of the
              character. Batman the animated series had an amazing cast and crew and
              the show won four Emmy Awards. This was the beginning of a role of a
              life time for Kevin, he would reprise the role for multiple adaptations,
              new Batman series, films and games.
